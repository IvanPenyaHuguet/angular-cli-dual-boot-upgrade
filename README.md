# Angular Cli 15 Hybrid Application Angularjs

An angular 15.X.X hybrid application with Angularjs 1.8.3 as an example of how to configure and use Angularjs in an Angular 15.X.X application to be able to dual boot both frameworks.

This configuration supports the AOT compilation for production mode, but as stated in AAAAAAAAAA, be careful with the components when building for optimization as the AOT could not compile some of the downgraded components.
